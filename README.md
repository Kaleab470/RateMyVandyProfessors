# Rate My Vandy Professors
Rate My Vandy Professors is a Google Chrome extension that puts RateMyProfessors ratings directly into Vanderbilt Class Search. It works by obtaining the names of each of the professors in Class Search, searching RateMyProfessors for the name, then returning and appending the <strong>overall score</strong> next to the name in the original webpage.
